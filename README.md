# naivebayes
This is my Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes implementation for classifying emails with spammy-sounding words. The dataset used for training and testing was [Spambase] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) from the UCI machine learning repository.  

##**Usage:**
To run the project, use `python naive_bayes.py` with the spambase.data file in the same path.

##**Dependencies:**
- [NumPy] (http://www.numpy.org) for calculations
